<p>Hi, my name is Karen Wang (aka Writing Senpai). I graduated from Stanford in 2017. After that, I worked at Google for five years. I have over eight years of experience in teaching and mentorship roles.</p>
<p>I am passionate about writing because I believe in the transformative power of effective communication. In our current age of artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, impactful writing is not just about putting words on paper; it's about expressing ideas clearly and persuasively. My goal is to inspire my students to discover their unique voices and to equip them with the tools they need to succeed in any writing endeavor.</p>
